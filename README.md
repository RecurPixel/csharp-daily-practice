# C# Daily Practice

## 🧩 **Level 1: Basics Variables, Data Types, Operators, Constol Structure**

### ✅ **Program 1: Simple Calculator**

**Topics**: Variables, Data Types, Arithmetic Operators, If-Else, Switch Statement

**Instructions**:

* Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
* Ask the user to choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
* Use a `switch` statement to perform the operation.
* Display the result.
* Handle division by zero with a proper error message.

📝 **Bonus**: Validate that the input is numeric using `int.TryParse()`.

### ✅ **Program 2: Number Guessing Game**

**Topics**: Variables, Random Numbers, Loops, If-Else, User Input

**Instructions**:

* Generate a random number between 1 and 100 using `Random`.
* Let the user guess the number.
* After each guess, tell them if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
* Count how many attempts the user took.
* When guessed correctly, display the number of attempts.

📝 **Bonus**: Add a maximum number of attempts (e.g., 10), then end the game if they don’t guess in time.

### ✅ **Program 3: Even or Odd Checker**

**Topics**: Variables, Data Types, Modulus Operator, If-Else

**Instructions**:

* Prompt the user to enter a number.
* Check if the number is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.
* Display the result.

📝 **Bonus**: Loop this check so the user can keep testing different numbers until they type "exit".

### ✅ **Program 4: Grade Calculator**

**Topics**: Variables, If-Else or Switch, Comparison Operators

**Instructions**:

* Ask the user to enter a numeric score (0 to 100).
* Convert the score into a grade using these rules:

  * 90-100: A
  * 80-89: B
  * 70-79: C
  * 60-69: D
  * Below 60: F
* Display the grade.

📝 **Bonus**: Prevent invalid scores like negative numbers or numbers over 100.

### ✅ **Program 5: Multiplication Table Generator**

**Topics**: Loops (for/while), Variables, Console Output

**Instructions**:

* Ask the user to input a number.
* Use a `for` loop to print its multiplication table up to 12.
  Example for 5:

  ```
  5 x 1 = 5
  5 x 2 = 10
  ...
  5 x 12 = 60
  ```

📝 **Bonus**: Ask for a "range" too (e.g., up to what number they want the table).
